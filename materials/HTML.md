# HTML 

- [Video by Dr. Chuck on HTML Basics](https://youtu.be/ZV9SG8unDYc?si=HnqrgfUNofJDb_Dg): A beginner-friendly video explaining the fundamentals of HTML.

## Overview
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.

It provides the basic structure of a webpage, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.


## Key Concepts
1. **Elements and Tags**: HTML uses elements defined by tags (e.g., `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<div>`, `<p>`, etc.) to structure content.
2. **Attributes**: Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element (e.g., `id`, `class`, `src`, `href`).
3. **Document Structure**: A typical HTML document includes a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections.
4. **Semantic HTML**: Using HTML elements according to their meaning (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) to improve accessibility and SEO.
5. **Forms and Input**: HTML provides various form elements (e.g., `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`) to collect user data.
6. **Links and Navigation**: Hyperlinks are created using the `<a>` tag, allowing navigation between different pages or sections.
7. **Multimedia**: HTML supports embedding images, audio, and video using tags like `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>`.

## Best Practices
- Always use semantic HTML to enhance accessibility.
- Validate your HTML code to ensure it adheres to web standards.
- Use meaningful names for IDs and classes.
- Keep the structure of your HTML clean and organized for better readability.
- Optimize images and multimedia for faster loading times.

## Historical Context

HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to share documents over the internet. Since then, it has evolved through various versions, with HTML5 being the latest standard, introducing new elements and APIs for modern web development.

- Next browser from CERN: [CERN Next Browser](https://next.cern.ch/)

The Next browser was one of the earliest web browsers developed at CERN, where Tim Berners-Lee worked. It played a crucial role in the initial adoption of the World Wide Web.

- NCSA Mosaic: [NCSA Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic)

NCSA Mosaic was one of the first web browsers to gain widespread popularity, significantly contributing to the growth of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s.

- Wayback Machine: [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/)

The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web, allowing users to access and view historical versions of web pages. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the evolution of web design and content over time.


## HTML is interpreted, not compiled

_Concept_: HTML is a markup language that is interpreted by web browsers. Unlike programming languages that require compilation, HTML code is read and rendered directly by the browser to display web pages.

Early web browsers, such as the WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus) developed by Tim Berners-Lee, interpreted HTML code to present content to users. This interpretation process allows for immediate rendering of web pages without the need for a separate compilation step.

When a user requests a web page, the browser retrieves the HTML file from the server and interprets the markup to construct the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents the structure of the web page, which the browser then uses to render the visual layout and content.

Early HTML could also tolerate minor syntax errors, allowing browsers to display content even if the HTML code was not perfectly formatted. This leniency helped in the rapid adoption of HTML as a standard for web content.

This motivated the creation of the W3C Consortium to establish formal standards for HTML and other web technologies, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different browsers and platforms.

## W3C Consortium

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. Founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the W3C aims to lead the Web to its full potential by creating protocols and guidelines that ensure interoperability and accessibility.

- Open standards: W3C develops standards for web technologies such as HTML, CSS, XML, and more.

- No proprietary control: W3C standards are open and free to use, promoting innovation and collaboration.

* _New rules for writing HTML established by W3C:_

- Tags must be closed: For example, `<br>` should be written as `<br />` in XHTML.
- Lowercase tags: All HTML tags should be written in lowercase (e.g., `<div>`, not `<DIV>`).
- Proper nesting: HTML elements must be properly nested within each other.
