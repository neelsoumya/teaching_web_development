# HTML 

## Overview
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.

It provides the basic structure of a webpage, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.


## Key Concepts
1. **Elements and Tags**: HTML uses elements defined by tags (e.g., `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<div>`, `<p>`, etc.) to structure content.
2. **Attributes**: Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element (e.g., `id`, `class`, `src`, `href`).
3. **Document Structure**: A typical HTML document includes a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections.
4. **Semantic HTML**: Using HTML elements according to their meaning (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) to improve accessibility and SEO.
5. **Forms and Input**: HTML provides various form elements (e.g., `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`) to collect user data.
6. **Links and Navigation**: Hyperlinks are created using the `<a>` tag, allowing navigation between different pages or sections.
7. **Multimedia**: HTML supports embedding images, audio, and video using tags like `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>`.

## Best Practices
- Always use semantic HTML to enhance accessibility.
- Validate your HTML code to ensure it adheres to web standards.
- Use meaningful names for IDs and classes.
- Keep the structure of your HTML clean and organized for better readability.
- Optimize images and multimedia for faster loading times.
