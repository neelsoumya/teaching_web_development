## Early Days

The history of web development dates back to the early 1990s when Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. The first website went live in 1991, and it was a simple page with text and hyperlinks. Early web development primarily involved creating static HTML pages.

## Evolution of Technologies

As the web grew in popularity, new technologies emerged to enhance web development. In the mid-1990s, JavaScript was introduced, allowing developers to create interactive elements on web pages. The late 1990s saw the rise of server-side scripting languages like PHP and ASP, enabling dynamic content generation.

## Apache history

The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache, is one of the most popular web server software applications in the world. It was created by a group of developers known as the Apache Group in 1995. 

Apache played a significant role in the growth of the World Wide Web by providing a reliable and open-source platform for hosting websites. Over the years, Apache has undergone numerous updates and improvements, making it a robust and flexible choice for web developers.

## Modern Web Development

In the 2000s, web development saw the rise of frameworks and libraries that simplified the development process. Technologies like AJAX allowed for asynchronous data loading, leading to more dynamic and responsive web applications. The introduction of HTML5 and CSS3 further enhanced the capabilities of web development, enabling richer multimedia experiences.

## Frameworks

The 2010s witnessed the emergence of various web development frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue.js for front-end development, and Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails for back-end development. 

These frameworks provided developers with tools and structures to build complex web applications more efficiently.

HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to share documents over the internet. Since then, it has evolved through various versions, with HTML5 being the latest standard, introducing new elements and APIs for modern web development.

- Next browser from CERN: [CERN Next Browser](https://next.cern.ch/)

The Next browser was one of the earliest web browsers developed at CERN, where Tim Berners-Lee worked. It played a crucial role in the initial adoption of the World Wide Web.

- NCSA Mosaic: [NCSA Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic)

NCSA Mosaic was one of the first web browsers to gain widespread popularity, significantly contributing to the growth of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s.

- Wayback Machine: [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/)

The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web, allowing users to access and view historical versions of web pages. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the evolution of web design and content over time.

For example, here is what the Yahoo homepage looked like in 1996: [Yahoo 1996](https://web.archive.org/web/19961220154510/https://www.yahoo.com/)
