# HCI principles and universal accessibility

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field focused on the design and use of computer technology, particularly the interfaces between people (users) and computers. The goal of HCI is to create systems that are efficient, effective, and satisfying for users.

## Key Principles of HCI

1. **User-Centered Design**: Designing systems with the needs, preferences, and limitations of end-users in mind.

2. **Consistency**: Ensuring that similar operations and elements behave in similar ways across the system to reduce the learning curve.

3. **Feedback**: Providing users with clear and immediate feedback on their actions to help them understand the results of their interactions.

4. **Affordance**: Designing elements in a way that suggests their functionality (e.g., buttons should look clickable).

5. **Error Prevention and Recovery**: Designing systems to minimize the chances of user errors and providing easy ways to recover from them.

6. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**: Allowing users to customize their interactions and providing shortcuts for experienced users.

7. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**: Keeping interfaces clean and uncluttered to avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary information.


## Universal Accessibility

Universal accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The goal is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can access and use technology effectively.

### Principles of Universal Accessibility

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presented in ways that users can perceive, regardless of their sensory abilities (e.g., providing text alternatives for images).

2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable by all users, including those with motor impairments (e.g., ensuring that all functionality is available from a keyboard).

3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable to all users (e.g., using clear and simple language).

4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies (e.g., ensuring compatibility with screen readers).

### Best Practices for Universal Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML to ensure that content is structured logically.
- Provide alternative text for images and multimedia content.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background.
- Design for keyboard navigation and avoid relying solely on mouse interactions.
- Test interfaces with assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## UX design

- User Experience (UX) design focuses on enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product. 

- Good UX design considers the entire user journey, from initial contact to final interaction.


## Interaction Design

- Interaction design is a subset of UX design that focuses specifically on the design of interactive digital products and services. It involves creating engaging interfaces with well-thought-out behaviors.


## Wireframing and Prototyping
- Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product. It helps in planning the layout and functionality before detailed design and development.
- Prototyping involves creating an early model of a product to test and validate design concepts and user interactions.
- 💡 Use _Miro_ or _Figma_ for wireframing and prototyping.


## Information Architecture

- Information architecture (IA) is the practice of organizing and structuring content in a way that makes it easy for users to find and navigate information.
- Good IA enhances usability and helps users understand where they are within a digital product.

## Sitemaps and Navigation Design

- Sitemaps are visual representations of the structure of a website or application, showing the relationships between different pages and sections.
- Navigation design focuses on creating intuitive and efficient ways for users to move through a digital product.
- [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) can be used to create sitemaps and navigation flows.

## Storyboarding

- Storyboarding is a technique used to visualize the user journey and interactions with a product through a series of illustrations or images.
- It helps designers understand user needs and behaviors, and plan the overall experience.

## Design Patterns

- Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems. They provide a standard way of solving specific design challenges and can improve consistency across a product.
- Examples include navigation menus, search bars, and form layouts.

## The elements of user experience

- 🚀 The elements of user experience framework, developed by Jesse James Garrett, outlines five key planes of user experience design: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface.
- [The User Experience](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements_ch02.pdf
): A detailed look at the components of user experience design.
- This framework helps designers understand the different aspects of user experience and how they interrelate.

- Each plane builds upon the previous one, starting with the overall strategy and moving down to the visual design of the interface.
- Plan your project so that work on each plane is completed before moving to the next.

- 🤔 When the Web started, there were two groups of people: one saw Web pages as documents (and applied principles from traditional media such as publishing), the other saw them as applications (and applied principles from desktop applications). 

- Today, most Web sites are a mixture of both.
