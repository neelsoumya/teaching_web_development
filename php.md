PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. It is especially suited for creating dynamic web pages and applications.

## Key Features of PHP

- **Server-Side Scripting:** PHP code is executed on the server, generating HTML that is sent to the client's browser.
- **Embedded in HTML:** PHP can be embedded directly within HTML code, making it easy to create dynamic web content.
- **Database Integration:** PHP has built-in support for various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, allowing for dynamic data-driven applications.
- **Cross-Platform:** PHP runs on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it versatile for different server environments.
- **Open Source:** PHP is free to use and has a large community that contributes to its development and provides support.
